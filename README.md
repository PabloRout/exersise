### Key Principles for Success
1.  **Progressive Overload:** Since you can't add much weight, you must add **reps** or **slow down the movement**. If 12 reps feels easy, do 15 next week.
2.  **Form:** Quality over quantity. Squeeze the muscle at the top of every rep.
3.  **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water during the workout.
